# loan-approval-streamlit-app

This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts whether a loan will be approved based on user input features like income, credit score, age, loan amount, and employment status. The model is trained on synthetic data, generated during runtime, simulating realistic loan applicant profiles.

🔍 Overview
Using a Random Forest Classifier, this app takes inputs from users and provides predictions along with confidence scores. It also features data visualizations like:

Scatter Plot of loan approvals vs income and loan amount

Feature Importance bar graph to understand which factors matter most

📌 Features
Real-time prediction of loan approval

Confidence score for prediction

Synthetic dataset generation (no real data used)

Plotly-based visual insights

Interactive UI using Streamlit

🧪 Justification for Synthetic Data
To demonstrate my data science and machine learning skills without using sensitive or proprietary data, I generated synthetic data that mimics real-world loan approval scenarios. This approach allows safe, ethical prototyping and showcases my ability to build predictive models, design user interfaces, and apply data visualization techniques in a realistic context.



🚀 Deployment
The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and can be accessed via the live link below. This deployment ensures easy access and demonstrates how machine learning models can be made interactive and user-friendly through a web interface.
